## S2 Cells

S2 cells are available to SAWGraph via the KnowWhereGraph project.
Level 13 are currently in use.

As of November 2024, S2 cell triplification and most S2 integration for AdministrativeRegions is done in one script. That script can be found in the [administrative-regions](/datasets/admin-regions) folder.
