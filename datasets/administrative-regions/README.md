## S2 Cells
S2 cells are available to SAWGraph via the KnowWhereGraph project. Level 13 are currently in use. The cells, their integration with Level 1 and Level 2 administrative regions, and a smaller "class statement only" version are all processed via the S2 script included here, which supercedes the scripts found in the [s2cells](/datasets/s2cells) folder.

**Script**: *S2_Cells&Integration_Levels1&2-2ttl.py*
* Creates a .ttl file of all S2 cells (Level 13) that overlap or are within a given state. This data is queried from KnowWhereGraph.
* Creates a .ttl file with the S2 integration (Level 13) for the given state. This data is queried from KnowWhereGraph.
* Creates a .ttl file with the S2 integration (Level 13) for all of the counties in the given state. This data is queried from KnowWhereGraph.
* Creates a .ttl file containing only class assignments (*?x* rdf:type kwg-ont:S2Cell_Level13) from the first file above. This can be imported into any SAWGraph repository so federation to the Spatial repository is not required to enforce instances being Level 13 S2 Cells.

## Administrative Regions
Administrative regions are classified according to GADM. SAWGraph uses the first four levels: 0 country (implicit), 1 state, 2 county, and 3 county subdivision.

**Script**: *AdminRegion_state_class-statements_2ttl.py*
* Creates a .ttl file containing only class assignments (*?x* rdf:type kwg-ont:AdministrativeRegion_*#*) from the above files. This can be imported into any SAWGraph repository so federation to the Spatial repository is not required to enforce instances being a specific administrative region level.

### Administrative Regions: Level 1 (KnowWhereGraph)
SAWGraph obtains these from [KnowWhereGraph](https://www.knowwheregraph.org/)) along with their S2 integration.

**Script**: *AdminRegionsLevel1&2-2ttl.py*
* Creates us_admin-regions_level-1.ttl file with US state information queried from [KnowWhereGraph](https://stko-kwg.geog.ucsb.edu/graphdb/sparql).
* Creates a unique .ttl file for each US state with that state's county information queried from KnowWhereGraph.
* Adds an `owl:sameAs` relation to a `dcgeoid` identifier for linking to Data Commons.

### Administrative Regions: Level 2 (KnowWhereGraph)
SAWGraph obtains these from [KnowWhereGraph](https://www.knowwheregraph.org/)) along with their S2 integration.

**Script**: See *AdminRegionsLevel1&2-2ttl.py* above.

### Administrative Regions: Level 3 (US Census Bureau County Subdivisions)
SAWGraph obtains these from [US Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles/index.php)).
* County subdivisions are often townships but can also correspond to towns, especially in New England.
* This is as deep as the US Census Bureau goes with municipal subdivisions.
* Actual towns and cities tend to be noncontiguous leaving a patchwork of gaps.
* SAWGraph currently uses the 2023 versions of the County Subdivision shapefiles.
* S2 integration is performed with the assistance of scripts from KnowWhereGraph

County subdivisions (cousub) are easy to link to Data Commons by their 10-digit FIPS code (GEOID).

**Script**: *AdminRegionsLevel3-2ttl.py*
* Creates a .ttl file for all county subdivisions in a given state from data in a TIGER shapefile from the US Census Bureau.
* See the table below for additional detail.
