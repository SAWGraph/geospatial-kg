## Administrative Regions
For SAWGraph, admininstrative regions include
* States (AdministrativeRegion_1; from KnowWhereGraph)
* Counties (AdministrativeRegion_2; from KnowWhereGraph)
* County subdivisions (AdministrativeRegion_3; from US Census Bureau) - these are often townships
  * Actual towns and cities tend to be noncontiguous leaving a patchwork of gaps
  * This is as deep as the US Census Bureau goes with municipal subdivisions

The representation of states and counties are from [GADM](https://gadm.org/data.html). There is no data for more granular regions, such as towns (AdministrativeRegion_3).

County subdivisions are easy to link to Data Commons by their 10-digit FIPS code (GEOID).
Their shapefiles are available [here](https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles/index.php).

Currently, the graph includes county subdivisions from Maine and Illinois.

* For the state of Maine (ME) town and parcel data can be downloaded from the Maine State GeoLibrary Data Catalog
